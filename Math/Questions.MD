## Non-Cyclical Number (Easy)

A non-cyclical number is an integer defined by the following algorithm:
Given a positive integer, replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the above step until the number equals 1, or it loops infinitely in a cycle which does not include 1.
If it stops at 1, then the number is a non-cyclical number.
Given a positive integer n, return true if it is a non-cyclical number, otherwise return false.

## Rotate Image (Medium)

Given a square n x n matrix of integers matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.
You must rotate the matrix in-place. Do not allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
