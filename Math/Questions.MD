## Non-Cyclical Number (Easy)

A non-cyclical number is an integer defined by the following algorithm:
Given a positive integer, replace it with the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the above step until the number equals 1, or it loops infinitely in a cycle which does not include 1.
If it stops at 1, then the number is a non-cyclical number.
Given a positive integer n, return true if it is a non-cyclical number, otherwise return false.

## Plus One (Easy)

You are given an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of a large integer. It is ordered from most significant to least significant digit, and it will not contain any leading zero.
Return the digits of the given integer after incrementing it by one.

## Rotate Image (Medium)

Given a square n x n matrix of integers matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.
You must rotate the matrix in-place. Do not allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
