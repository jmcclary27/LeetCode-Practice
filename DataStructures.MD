# Explanations of Data Structures and Their Common Algorithms

## Hashmaps

A hashmap is a data structure that stores key value pairs. This works by converting a key to a certain integer value, and that integer value maps to a specific index in an underlying array, and that index holds the value of this map (specifically in python, the underlying array is implemented in C code). Since the hashfunction does not iterate through the underlying array and instead performs a lookup, insert, find, and delete all have an O(1) amortized runtime complexity. For the keys of the hashmaps, they must be immutible, with the most common being strings, integers, floats, and tuples. Mutable data types like lists, dictionaries, and sets cannot be hashed. Common methods include: get(key, default), setdefault(key, default), pop(key), popitem(), keys(), values(), and items(), all of which are O(1) runtime complexity. In python, there are also a couple of alternatives to just using dict. There is defaultdict(type), which sets all values to have a default datatype specified within the parenthesis. There is also Counter (imported from collections), which is like a set that actually stores frequency values. The main idea of when to use a hashmap is when you need a fast lookup by values, not just index. If you come across some sort of problem that requires repeated value lookup, it is most likely a hashmap problem!
