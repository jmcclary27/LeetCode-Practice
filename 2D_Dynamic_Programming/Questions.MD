## Unique Paths (Medium)

There is an m x n grid where you are allowed to move either down or to the right at any point in time.
Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that can be taken from the top-left corner of the grid (grid[0][0]) to the bottom-right corner (grid[m - 1][n - 1]).
You may assume the output will fit in a 32-bit integer.
