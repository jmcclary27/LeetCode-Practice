## Single Number (Easy)

You are given a non-empty array of integers nums. Every integer appears twice except for one.
Return the integer that appears only once.
You must implement a solution with 
O(n) runtime complexity and use only 
O(1) extra space.

## Number of One Bits (Easy)

You are given an unsigned integer n. Return the number of 1 bits in its binary representation.
You may assume n is a non-negative integer which fits within 32-bits.
