## Maximum Subarray (Medium)

Given an array of integers nums, find the subarray with the largest sum and return the sum.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Jump Game (Medium)

You are given an integer array nums where each element nums[i] indicates your maximum jump length at that position.
Return true if you can reach the last index starting from index 0, or false otherwise.

## Jump Game II (Medium)

You are given an array of integers nums, where nums[i] represents the maximum length of a jump towards the right from index i. For example, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any index i + j where:
j <= nums[i]
i + j < nums.length
You are initially positioned at nums[0].
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach the last position in the array (index nums.length - 1). You may assume there is always a valid answer.
