# Here is where I will now be committing all of my LeetCode Practice

## NeetCode 150
I am going through the NeetCode 150, so the questions are grouped into folders by their topic, and within those folders are python files with answers and comments for each question, as well as an MD file
containing the questions and my explanations of them.

## Regular LeetCode
Anytime I do questions just through plain 'ol LeetCode, they will be in the Leetcode folder, grouped by question number. There is also an MD file in that folder.
