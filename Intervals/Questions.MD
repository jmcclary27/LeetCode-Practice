## Meeting Rooms (Easy)

Given an array of meeting time interval objects consisting of start and end times [[start_1,end_1],[start_2,end_2],...] (start_i < end_i), determine if a person could add all meetings to their schedule without any conflicts.
Note: (0,8),(8,10) is not considered a conflict at 8

## Merge Intervals(Medium)

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
You may return the answer in any order.
Note: Intervals are non-overlapping if they have no common point. For example, [1, 2] and [3, 4] are non-overlapping, but [1, 2] and [2, 3] are overlapping.
